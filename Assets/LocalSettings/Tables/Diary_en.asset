      then, I really liked a guy. We went on quite a few dates\u2026 until my father
      found out \u2013 and he was furious. You see, my family had founded a tech
      company, so we were very wealthy. His parents, though, worked at that same
      company. At some point, a conflict broke out between our families. His parents
      were fired, and since then, they could barely make ends meet. My father had
      ties with the yakuza\u2026 and he decided to \u201Cwarn\u201D the guy."
